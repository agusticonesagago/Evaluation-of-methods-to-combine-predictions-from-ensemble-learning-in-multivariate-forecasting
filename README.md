## Description
This project studies different possibilities to make good predictions based on machine learning algorithms, but without requiring great theoretical knowl-edge from the users.  Moreover, a software package that implements the predictionprocess has been developed. The software is an ensemble method that first predicts avalue taking into account different algorithms at the same time, and then it combinestheir results considering also the previous performance of each algorithm to obtaina final prediction of the value.  Moreover, the solution proposed and implementedin this project can also predict according to a concrete objective (e.g., optimize theprediction,  or do not exceed the real value) because not every prediction problemis subject to the same constraints.  We have experimented and validated the imple-mentation with three different cases.  In all of them, a better performance has beenobtained in comparison with each of the algorithms involved, reaching improvementsof 45 to 95%.
